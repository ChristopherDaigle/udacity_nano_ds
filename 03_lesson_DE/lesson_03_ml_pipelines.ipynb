    "### Pipeline: SKLearn function\n",
    "Instead of writing this in the form of unique functions, we can use SKLearn's `Pipeline()` method\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you'll find a simple example of a machine learning workflow where we generate features from text data using count vectorizer and tf-idf transformer, and then fit it to a random forest classifier. Before we get into using pipelines, let's first use this example to go over some scikit-learn terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Estimator:** An estimator is any object that learns from data, whether it's a classification, regression, or clustering algorithm, or a transformer that extracts or filters useful features from raw data. Since estimators learn from data, they each must have a fit method that takes a dataset. In the example below, the CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer, and RandomForestClassifier are all estimators, and each have a fit method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transform:** A transformer is a specific type of estimator that has a fit method to learn from training data, and then a transform method to apply a transformation model to new data. These transformations can include cleaning, reducing, expanding, or generating features. In the example below, CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer are transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Predictor:** A predictor is a specific type of estimator that has a predict method to predict on test data based on a supervised learning algorithm, and has a fit method to train the model on training data. The final estimator, RandomForestClassifier, in the example below is a predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning tasks, it's pretty common to have a very specific sequence of transformers to fit to data before applying a final estimator, such as this classifier. And normally, we'd have to initialize all the estimators, fit and transform the training data for each of the transformers, and then fit to the final estimator. Next, we'd have to call transform for each transformer again to the test data, and finally call predict on the final estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE** Every step of the `Pipeline()` has to be a transformer *EXCEPT* for the last step\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Without `Pipeline()`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    vect = CountVectorizer()\n",
    "    tfidf = TfidfTransformer()\n",
    "    clf = RandomForestClassifier()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # train classifier\n",
    "    X_train_counts = vect.fit_transform(X_train)\n",
    "    X_train_tfidf = tfidf.fit_transform(X_train_counts)\n",
    "    clf.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # predict on test data\n",
    "    X_test_counts = vect.transform(X_test)\n",
    "    X_test_tfidf = tfidf.transform(X_test_counts)\n",
    "    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_tfidf)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With `Pipeline()`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, random_state=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# build pipeline\n",
    "pipeline = Pipeline([\n",
    "    ('vect', CountVectorizer(tokenizer=tokenize)),\n",
    "    ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()),\n",
    "    ('clf', RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0))\n",
    "])\n",
    "# train classifier\n",
    "pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "# predict on test data\n",
    "y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, by fitting our pipeline to the training data, we're accomplishing exactly what we would by fitting and transforming each of these steps to our training data one by one. Similarly, when we call `predict` on our pipeline to our test data, we're accomplishing what we would by calling `transform` on each of our transformer objects to our test data and then calling `predict` on our final estimator. Not only does this make our code much shorter and simpler, it has other great advantages, which we'll cover in the next video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that every step of this pipeline has to be a transformer, except for the last step, which can be of an estimator type. Pipeline takes on all the methods of whatever the last estimator in its sequence is. For example, here, since the final estimator of our pipeline is a classifier, the pipeline object can be used as a classifier, taking on the `fit` and `predict` methods of its last step. Alternatively, if the last estimator was a transformer, then pipeline would be a transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline: Advantages\n",
    "#### 1. Simplicity and Convencience\n",
    "* **Automates repetitive steps** - Chaining all of your steps into one estimator allows you to fit and predict on all steps of your sequence automatically with one call. It handles smaller steps for you, so you can focus on implementing higher level changes swiftly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Easily understandable workflow** - Not only does this make your code more concise, it also makes your workflow much easier to understand and modify. Without Pipeline, your model can easily turn into messy spaghetti code from all the adjustments and experimentation required to improve your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reduces mental workload** - Because Pipeline automates the intermediate actions required to execute each step, it reduces the mental burden of having to keep track of all your data transformations. Using Pipeline may require some extra work at the beginning of your modeling process, but it prevents a lot of headaches later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Optimizing Entire Workflow\n",
    "* **Grid Search:** Method that automates the process of testing different hyper parameters to optimize a model.\n",
    "* By running grid search on your pipeline, you're able to optimize your entire workflow, including data transformation and modeling steps. This accounts for any interactions among the steps that may affect the final metrics.\n",
    "* Without grid search, tuning these parameters can be painfully slow, incomplete, and messy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Preventing Data leakage\n",
    "* Using Pipeline, all transformations for data preparation and feature extractions occur within each fold of the cross validation process.\n",
    "* This prevents common mistakes where you’d allow your training process to be influenced by your test data - for example, if you used the entire training dataset to normalize or extract features from your data."

    "## Pipeline and Feature Unions\n",
    "* **Feature Union:** Feature union is a class in scikit-learn’s Pipeline module that allows us to perform steps in parallel and take the union of their results for the next step.\n",
    "* A pipeline performs a list of steps in a linear sequence, while a feature union performs a list of steps in parallel and then combines their results.\n",

Keep in mind that `TextLengthExtractor` is a custom transformer that is already built in a separate file and imported for this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Feature Union\n",
    "[VIDEO](https://youtu.be/QmE6CMGar1U)\n",
    "Taking the example from the previous video, let's say you wanted to extract two different kinds of features from the same text column - tfidf values, and the length of the text. Your first approach might be to create an additional column from the `text` column called `text_length` like this. Then both `text` and `text_length` can be part of your feature matrix. But now your pipeline would break. You can't run `CountVectorizer` on `NumPy` arrays of strings and integers.\n",

If only you could fit it on the original text data, rather than the output of the previous transformer. But you need the outputs of `TfiddfTransformer` and `TextLengthExtractor` to feed into the classifier as input.\n",

Also like pipelines, feature unions combine a list of estimators to become a single estimator. However, a feature union runs its estimators in parallel, rather than in a sequence as a pipeline does. In this example, the estimators run in parallel are `nlp_pipeline` and `text_length`.

    "## Pipelines and Gridsearch\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"gs_pipe_0.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A powerful benefit to using `pipeline` is the ability to perform a `grid search` on your **entire workflow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning algorithms have a set of parameters that need tuning. `Grid search` is a tool that allows you to define a “grid” of parameters, or a set of values to check. Your computer automates the process of trying out all possible combinations of values. `Grid search` scores each combination with `cross validation`, and uses the `cross validation` score to determine the parameters that produce the most optimal model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running `grid search` on your `pipeline` allows you to try many parameter values thoroughly and conveniently, for both your data transformations and estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "And again, although you can also run `grid search` on just a single classifier, **running it on your whole pipeline helps you test multiple parameter combinations across your entire pipeline**. This accounts for interactions among parameters not just in your model, but data preparation steps as well.\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have seen before, `grid search` can be used to optimize hyper parameters of a model. Here is a simple example that uses `grid search` to find parameters for a `support vector classifier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need to do is create a dictionary of `parameters` to search, using keys for the names of the parameters and values for the list of parameter values to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, pass the model and parameter grid to the `grid search` object. Now when you call fit on this grid search object, it will run cross validation on all different combinations of these parameters to find the best combination of parameters for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "parameters = {\n",
    "    'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf'],\n",
    "    'C':[1, 10]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "svc = SVC()\n",
    "clf = GridSearchCV(svc, parameters)\n",
    "clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider if we had a data preprocessing step, where we standardized the data using `StandardScaler` like this.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scaler = StandardScaler()\n",
    "scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "parameters = {\n",
    "    'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf'],\n",
    "    'C':[1, 10]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "svc = SVC()\n",
    "clf = GridSearchCV(svc, parameters)\n",
    "clf.fit(scaled_data, y_train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem okay at first, but\n",
    "* if you standardize your whole training dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**AND**\n",
    "* then use cross validation in grid search to evaluate your model\n",
    "**you've got data leakage**\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search uses cross validation to score your model, **meaning it splits your training data into folds of train and validation sets**\n",
    "1. trains your model on the train set\n",
    "2. scores it on the validation set\n",
    "3. and does so multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, each time, or fold, that this happens, the **model already has knowledge of the validation set because all the data was rescaled based on the distribution of the whole training dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important factors like:\n",
    "* mean\n",
    "* standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "**are influenced by the whole dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "*This means the model perform better than it really should on unseen data, since **information about the validation set is always baked into the rescaled values** of your train dataset.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to fix this, would be to make sure you run standard scaler only on the training set, and not the validation set within each fold of cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipelines allow you to do just this.\n",
    "___\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pipeline = Pipeline([\n",
    "    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),\n",
    "    ('clf', SVC())\n",
    "])\n",
    "\n",
    "parameters = {\n",
    "    'scaler__with_mean': [True, False]\n",
    "    'clf__kernel': ['linear', 'rbf'],\n",
    "    'clf__C':[1, 10]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "cv = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid=parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "cv.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "y_pred = cv.predict(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, since the rescaling is included as part of the pipeline, the **standardization doesn't happen until we run grid search**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning in each fold of cross validation, the rescaling is done only on the data that the model is trained on, **preventing leakage from the validation set**. As you can see, pipelines are very valuable to removing the risk of data leakage during the data preparation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on Run Time**\n",
    "Running grid search can take a while, especially if you are searching over a lot of parameters! If you want to reduce it to a few minutes, try commenting out some of your parameters to grid search over just 1 or 2 parameters with a small number of values each. Once you know that works, feel free to add more parameters and see how well your final model can perform! You can try this out in the next page."
