    "### Overview: Why Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has a few benefits over procedural programming, which is the programming style you most likely first learned. As you'll see in this lesson,\n",
    "* OOP allows you to create large, modular programs that can easily expand over time\n",
    "* OOPs hide the implementation from the end-user\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider Python packages like [Scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/). These are all Python packages built with object-oriented programming. Scikit-learn, for example, is a relatively large and complex package built with object-oriented programming. This package has expanded over the years with new functionality and new algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you train a machine learning algorithm with Scikit-learn, you don't have to know anything about how the algorithms work or how they were coded. You can focus directly on the modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example taken from the [Scikit-learn website](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn import svm\n",
    "X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]\n",
    "y = [0, 1]\n",
    "clf = svm.SVC()\n",
    "clf.fit(X, y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How does Scikit-learn train the SVM model? You don't need to know because the implementation is hidden with object-oriented programming. If the implementation changes, you as a user of Scikit-learn might not ever find out. Whether or not you SHOULD understand how SVM works is a different question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll practice the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. By the end of the lesson, you'll have built a Python package using object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson uses classroom workspaces that contain all of the files and functionality you will need.

    "the underscore in front of price (i.e. `self._price = shirt_price`) is a somewhat controversial Python convention. In other languages like C++ or Java, price could be explicitly labeled as a private variable. This would *prohibit an object from accessing the price attribute directly* like `shirt_one._price = 15`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python does not distinguish between private and public variables like other languages. Therefore, there is some controversy about using the underscore convention as well as get and set methods in Python. Why use get and set methods in Python when Python wasn't designed to use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, you'll find that some Python programmers develop object-oriented programs using get and set methods anyway. Following the Python convention, the underscore in front of price is to let a programmer know that price should only be accessed with get and set methods rather than accessing price directly with `shirt_one._price`. However, a programmer could still access `_price` directly because there is nothing in the Python language to prevent the direct access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To reiterate**, a programmer could technically still do something like `shirt_one._price = 10`, and the code would work. But *accessing price directly, in this case, would not be following the intent of how the Shirt class was designed.*\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the benefits of set and get methods is that, as previously mentioned in the course, you can hide the implementation from your user. Maybe originally a variable was coded as a list and later became a dictionary. With set and get methods, you could easily change how that variable gets accessed. Without set and get methods, you'd have to go to every place in the code that accessed the variable directly and change the code.\n",

Python does not have this option.\n",
