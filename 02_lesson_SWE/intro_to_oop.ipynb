    "### Overview: Why Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has a few benefits over procedural programming, which is the programming style you most likely first learned. As you'll see in this lesson,\n",
    "* OOP allows you to create large, modular programs that can easily expand over time\n",
    "* OOPs hide the implementation from the end-user\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider Python packages like [Scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/). These are all Python packages built with object-oriented programming. Scikit-learn, for example, is a relatively large and complex package built with object-oriented programming. This package has expanded over the years with new functionality and new algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you train a machine learning algorithm with Scikit-learn, you don't have to know anything about how the algorithms work or how they were coded. You can focus directly on the modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example taken from the [Scikit-learn website](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn import svm\n",
    "X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]\n",
    "y = [0, 1]\n",
    "clf = svm.SVC()\n",
    "clf.fit(X, y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How does Scikit-learn train the SVM model? You don't need to know because the implementation is hidden with object-oriented programming. If the implementation changes, you as a user of Scikit-learn might not ever find out. Whether or not you SHOULD understand how SVM works is a different question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll practice the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. By the end of the lesson, you'll have built a Python package using object-oriented programming.\n",

    "    self._price = shirt_price\n",

    "\n",
    "the underscore in front of price (i.e. `self._price = shirt_price`) is a somewhat controversial Python convention. In other languages like C++ or Java, price could be explicitly labeled as a private variable. This would *prohibit an object from accessing the price attribute directly* like `shirt_one._price = 15`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python does not distinguish between private and public variables like other languages. Therefore, there is some controversy about using the underscore convention as well as get and set methods in Python. Why use get and set methods in Python when Python wasn't designed to use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, you'll find that some Python programmers develop object-oriented programs using get and set methods anyway. Following the Python convention, the underscore in front of price is to let a programmer know that price should only be accessed with get and set methods rather than accessing price directly with `shirt_one._price`. However, a programmer could still access `_price` directly because there is nothing in the Python language to prevent the direct access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To reiterate**, a programmer could technically still do something like `shirt_one._price = 10`, and the code would work. But *accessing price directly, in this case, would not be following the intent of how the Shirt class was designed.*\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the benefits of set and get methods is that, as previously mentioned in the course, you can hide the implementation from your user. Maybe originally a variable was coded as a list and later became a dictionary. With set and get methods, you could easily change how that variable gets accessed. Without set and get methods, you'd have to go to every place in the code that accessed the variable directly and change the code.\n",

Python does not have this option.\n",

    ">**Windows VS macOS VS Linux**<br>\n",
    "Linux, which our Udacity classroom workspaces use, is an operating system like Windows or macOS. One important difference is that Linux is free and open source whereas Windows is owned by Microsoft and macOS by Apple.<br><br>\n",
    "Throughout the lesson, you can do all of your work in a classroom workspace. These workspaces provide interfaces that connect to [virtual machines in the cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/). However, if you want to run this code locally on your computer, the commands to use might be slightly different.<br><br>\n",
    "If you are using macOS, you can open an application called \"Terminal\" and essentially use the same commands that you use in the workspace. That is because [Linux and MacOS are related.](https://www.quora.com/Is-macOS-essentially-built-on-top-of-Linux)<br><br>\n",
    "If you are using Windows, the analogous application is called console. The console commands can be somewhat different than the terminal commands. A search engine like Google is your best friend for finding the right commands in a Windows environment.<br><br>\n",
    "The classroom workspace has one major benefit. You can do whatever you want to the workspace including installing Python packages. And if something goes wrong, you can reset the workspace and start with a clean slate; however, always download your code files or commit your code to github or gitlab before resetting a workspace. Otherwise, you will lose your code!"

    "A package is a collection of Python modules. Although the *previous code might already seem like it was a Python package because it contained multiple files*, a Python package also needs an `__init__.py` file. In this section, you'll learn how to create this `__init__.py` file and then pip install the package into your local Python installation."

    "### What is pip?\n",
    "Pip is a [Python package manager](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) that helps with installing and uninstalling Python packages. You might have used pip to install packages using the command line: `pip install numpy`. When you execute a command like `pip install numpy`, pip will download the package from a Python package repository called [PyPi](https://pypi.org/). However, for this next exercise, you'll use pip to install a Python package from a local folder on your computer. The last part of the lesson will focus on uploading packages to PyPi so that you can share your package with the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can complete this entire lesson within the classroom using the provided workspaces; however, if you want to develop a package locally on your computer, you should consider setting up a virtual environment. That way if you install your package on your computer, the package won't install into your main Python installation. Before starting the next exercise, the next part of the lesson will discuss what virtual environments are and how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing a package\n",
    "A python package must have the `__init__.py` file, but it can be empty. However, if you have something like:\n",
    "`__init__.py` in the `distributions` folder:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from .Gaussiandistributions import Gaussian\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you can later just use\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from distributions import Gaussian\n",
    "```\n",
    "to import the module directly\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, if `__init__.py` is blank, it would require:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from distributions.Gaussiandistributions import Gaussian\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a package that `pip` will be able to install, the home directory of the package should contain a file titled `setup.py` and may look something like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from setuptools import setup\n",
    "\n",
    "setup(name='distributions',\n",
    "      version='0.1',\n",
    "      description='Gaussian distributions',\n",
    "      packages=['distributions'],\n",
    "      zip_safe=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Installing the package\n",
    "1. Go to the home directory inside the package where the `setup.py` module exists (e.g. `cd python_package_example`)\n",
    "2. In the terminal, enter: `pip install .`\n",
    "> - This tells `pip` to search for the `setup.py` and install the elements in `packages` (i.e. `'distributions'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the package\n",
    "Now that the packge has been installed with `pip install .`, it is available in the environment\n",
    "1. Open python (IDE or terminal)\n",
    "2. Now the package can be used as such:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> from distributions import Gaussian\n",
    ">>> gaussian_one = Gaussian(10,5)\n",
    ">>> gaussian_one.mean\n",
    "10\n",
    ">>> gaussian_one.stdev\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking installation of the package:\n",
    "`pip` installs package to a specific location. That location can be checked while in python\n",
    "1. Open python\n",
    "2. For the package you're interested in, if it's installed, check its location as such\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import distributions\n",
    ">>> distributions.__file__\n",
    "'/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/distributions/__init__.py'\n",

    "# Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Environments\n",
    "If you decide to install your package on your local computer, you'll want to create a virtual environment. A virtual environment is a silo-ed Python installation apart from your main Python installation. That way you can install packages and delete the virtual environment without affecting your main Python installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about two different Python environment managers: conda and venv. You can create virtual environments with either one. Below you'll read about each of these environment managers including some advantages and disadvantages. If you've taken other data science, machine learning or artificial intelligence courses at Udacity, you're probably already familiar with [conda](https://conda.io/docs/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda\n",
    "Conda does two things: manages packages and manages environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a package manager, conda makes it easy to install Python packages especially for data science. For instance, typing `conda install numpy` will install the numpy package.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an environment manager, conda allows you to create silo-ed Python installations. With an environment manager, you can install packages on your computer without affecting your main Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line code looks something like this:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda create --name environment_name\n",
    "source activate environment_name\n",
    "conda install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pip and Venv\n",
    "There are other environmental managers and package managers besides conda. For example, venv is an environment manager that comes pre-installed with Python 3. Pip is a package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pip can only manage Python packages whereas conda is a language agnostic package manager. In fact, conda was invented because pip could not handle data science packages that depended on libraries outside of Python. If you look at the [history of conda](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/#Myth-#5:-conda-doesn't-work-with-virtualenv,-so-it's-useless-for-my-workflow), you'll find that the software engineers behind conda needed a way to manage data science packages (NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.) that relied on libraries outside of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda manages environments AND packages. Pip only manages packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use venv and pip, the commands look something like this:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python3 -m venv environment_name\n",
    "source environment_name/bin/activate\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing**\n",
    "Whether you choose to create environments with venv or conda will depend on your use case. Conda is very helpful for data science projects, but **conda can make generic Python software development a bit more confusing**; that's the case for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you create a conda environment, activate the environment, and then pip install the distributions package, you'll find that the system installs your package [globally rather than in your local conda environment](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/1429). However, if you create the conda environment and install pip simultaneously, you'll find that pip behaves as expected installing packages into your local environment:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda create --name environment_name pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, using pip with venv works as expected. Pip and venv tend to be used for generic software development projects including web development. For this lesson on creating packages, you can use conda or venv if you want to develop locally on your computer and install your package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions for venv\n",
    "Here are instructions about how to set up virtual environments on a macOS, Linux, or Windows machine using the terminal: [instructions link](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtualenv/).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are a few notes for understanding the tutorial:\n",
    "* If you are using Python 2.7.9 or later (including Python 3), the Python installation should already come with the Python package manager called pip. There is no need to install it\n",
    "* `env` is the name of the environment you want to create. You can call `env` anything you want\n",
    "* Python 3 comes with a virtual environment package pre-installed. So instead of typing `python3 -m virtualenv env`, you can type `python3 -m venv env` to create a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've activated a virtual environment, you can then use terminal commands to go into the directory where your Python library is stored. And then you can run `pip install .`. In the next section, you can practice pip installing and/or creating virtual environments in the classroom workspace. You'll see that creating a virtual environment actually creates a new folder containing a Python installation. Deleting this folder will remove the virtual environment."

    "**Tutorial on distributing packages**\n",
    "This link has a good tutorial on distributing Python packages including more configuration options for your `setup.py` file: [tutorial on distributing packages](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/). You'll notice that the python command to run the `setup.py` is slightly different with:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command will still output a folder called `dist`. The difference is that you will get both a .tar.gz file and a .whl file. The .tar.gz file is called a *source archive* whereas the .whl file is a *built distribution*. The .whl file is a newer type of installation file for Python packages. When you pip install a package, pip will first look for a whl file (wheel file) and if there isn't one, will then look for the tar.gz file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tar.gz file, ie an sdist, contains the files needed to [compile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) and install a Python package. A whl file, i.e. *a built distribution*, only needs to be copied to the proper place for installation. Behind the scenes, pip installing a whl file has fewer steps than a tar.gz file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than this command, the rest of the steps for uploading to PyPi are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Links**\n",

    "**Hints and Helpful Links**\n",
    "Because this exercise requires writing and organizing code in a specific way, you might have to rewatch some of the lecture videos especially the \"Putting Code on PyPi\" concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you upload your code to PyPi, you should first pip install the package locally to make sure everything works as expected. The \"Making a Package\" and \"Virtual Environments\" lesson concepts should be helpful. You should also consider writing unit tests to test the functionality of your package. In the object-oriented programming lesson workspace, there were unit tests inside the 4a_binomial_package folder that you can use to help you get started. Those were in a file called test.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object-oriented programming lesson included a complete, working package called dsnd-probability. We encourage you to code a project from scratch; however, if you get stuck, use the dsnd-probability package code as a template. It already contains all of the necessary files you'll need for creating a package. It's also a simple example of object-oriented code. You can use these files, including the setup.py and setup.cfg files, to help structure your own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those files are located in the \"Exercise: Upload to PyPi\" section inside the \"5_exercise_upload_to_pypi\" folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the lesson on object-oriented programming, you might find [this package building summary guide from the Python website](https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/) helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a much more detailed explanation of distributing Python packages, check out the documentation on Distutils.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Introduction](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/introduction.html)\n",
    "2. [setup.py script](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html)\n",

    "6. [uploading to PyPi](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/packageindex.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uploading to PyPi**\n",
    "When you are ready to upload your package, you can first upload to the [PyPi test repository](https://test.pypi.org/). Once everything is working as expected, you can upload to the public facing [PyPi repository](https://pypi.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, you'll need to create a username for both the test and public facing repositories. You'll also need to pip install the twine package with: `pip install twine`. You can rewatch the lesson videos to see how to upload your package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue on to the next sections to get some troubleshooting tips, and access the project workspace. When you're finished with your project, show off your work on a personal website, GitHub, and LinkedIn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Re-uploading and Versioning**\n",
    "Once you upload your package to PyPi, you cannot upload the same version again. All that means is that you need to go into your setup.py file and change the version number. For example, if you uploaded a package with `version = 0.1.1`, then you'll need to change this to something else like `version = 0.1.2`.\n",
    "\n",
