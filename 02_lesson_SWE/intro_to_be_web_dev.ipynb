    "# The Backend\n",
    "In this next part of the lesson, you'll build a backend using Flask. Because Flask is written in Python, you can use any Python library in your backend including pandas and scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the lesson, you'll practice:\n",
    "* setting up the backend\n",
    "* linking the backend and the frontend together\n",
    "* deploying the app to a server so that the app is available from a web address\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Flask?\n",
    "[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). A web framework takes care of all the routing needed to organize a web page so that you don't have to write the code yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type \"http://www.udacity.com\" into a browser, your computer sends out a request to another computer (ie the server) where the Udacity website is stored. Then the Udacity server sends you the files needed to render the website in your browser. The Udacity computer is called a server because it \"serves\" you the files that you requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTTP part of the web address stands for Hypter-text Transfer Protocol. HTTP defines a standard way of sending and receiving messages over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you hit enter in your browser, your computer says \"get me the files for the web page at www.udacity.com\": except that message is sent to the server with the syntax governed by HTTP. Then the server sends out the files via the protocol as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "There needs to be some software on the server that can interpret these HTTP requests and send out the correct files. That's where a web framework like Flask comes into play. A framework abstracts the code for receiving requests as well as interpreting the requests and sending out the correct files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Flask?\n",
    "* First and foremost, you'll be working with Flask because it is written in Python. You won't need to learn a new programming language.\n",
    "* Flask is also a relatively simple framework, so it's good for making a small web app.\n",
    "* Because Flask is written in Python, you can use Flask with any other Python library including pandas, numpy and scikit-learn. In this lesson, you'll be deploying a data dashboard and pandas will help get the data ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue on to start building the backend."

    "## Using Flask in the Classroom Workspace\n",
    "In the next part of the lesson, you'll see a classroom workspace. The classroom workspace already has Flask set up for you. So for now, all you need to do to run the Flask app is to open a Terminal and type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python worldbank.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which executes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from worldbankapp import app\n",
    "app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=1001, debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `worldbankapp` directory contains a few files:\n",
    "1. `__init__.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "from worldbankapp import routes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `routes.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from worldbankapp import app\n",
    "from flask import render_template\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "@app.route('index')\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return render_template('index.html')\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/project-one')\n",
    "def project_one():\n",
    "    return render_template('project_one.html')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**and others**\n",
    "\n",
    "That assumes you are in the default workspace directory within Terminal. That will get the server running.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating New Pages\n",
    "To create a new web page, you first need to specify the route in the routes.py as well as the name of the html template.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route('/new-route')\n",
    "def render_the_route():\n",
    "    return render_template('new_route.html')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The route name, function name, and template name do not have to match; however, it's good practice to make them similar so that the code is easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `new_route.html` file must go in the `templates` folder. Flask automatically looks for html files in the `templates` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is @app.route?\n",
    "To use Flask, you don't necessarily need to know what `@app.route` is doing. You only have to remember that the path you place inside of `@app.route()` will be the web address. And then the function you write below `@app.route()` is used to render the correct html template file for the web address.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `@` symbol is used for decorators. Decorators are a shorthand way to input a function into another function. Take a look at this code. Python allows you to use a function as an input to another function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def decorator(input_function):\n",
    "\n",
    "    return input_function\n",
    "\n",
    "def input_function():\n",
    "    print(\"I am an input function\")\n",
    "\n",
    "decorator_example = decorator(input_function)\n",
    "decorator_example()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Running this code will print the string:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> \"I am an input function\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Decorators provide a short-hand way of getting the same behavior:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def decorator(input_function):\n",
    "    print(\"Decorator function\")\n",
    "    return input_function\n",
    "\n",
    "@decorator\n",
    "def input_function():\n",
    "    print(\"I am an input function\")\n",
    "\n",
    "input_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code will print out:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> \"Decorator function\"\n",
    ">>> \"I am an input function\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a decorator function, you could get the same behavior with the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "input_function = decorator(input_function)\n",
    "input_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `@app.route()` has the `.` symbol, there's an implication that `app` is a class (or an instance of a class) and route is a method of that class. Hence a function written underneath `@app.route()` is going to get passed into the route method. The purpose of `@app.route()` is to make sure the correct web address gets associated with the correct html template. This code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route('/homepage')\n",
    "def some_function():\n",
    "    return render_template('index.html')\n",
    "```\n",
    "is ensuring that the web address 'www.website.com/homepage' is associated with the `index.html` template.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to know more details about decorators and how `@app.route()` works, check out these tutorials:\n",
    "* [how @app.route works](https://ains.co/blog/things-which-arent-magic-flask-part-1.html)\n",
