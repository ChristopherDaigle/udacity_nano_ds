    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations are being used to recommend everything from movies to music to friends to new destinations. There are three main methods for implementing recommendations that you will become familiar with throughout this lesson:\n",
    "* Knowledge Based Recommendations\n",
    "* Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendations\n",
    "* Content Based Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this lesson, you will be ready for the upcoming lessons where you will:\n",
    "* Learn about more advanced techniques.\n",
    "* Deploy your recommendations in a web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three lessons will aim to be extremely practical. The lessons will require that you write code to implement a number of different recommendation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Recommendations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* LinkedIn and Facebook\n",
    "> Both LinkedIn and Facebook have recommendations for connections (business of friends) similar to what is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* AirBnB Experiences and Destinations\n",
    "> AirBnB uses recommendations to determine experiences and destinations for their users.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Walmart, Amazon, and Other Retailers\n",
    "> As humans on the Internet, we all get pinged with constant recommendations from retailers."

    "### Types of Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will be working with the MovieTweetings data to apply each of the three methods of recommendations:\n",
    "1. Knowledge Based Recommendations\n",
    "2. Collaborative Filtering Based Recommendations\n",
    "3. Content Based Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Collaborative Filtering, there are two main branches:\n",
    "1. Model Based Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "2. Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will implement Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering. In the next lesson, you will implement Model Based Collaborative Filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarity Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement Neighborhood Based Collaborative Filtering, you will learn about some common ways to measure the similarity between two users (or two items) including:\n",
    "1. Pearson's correlation coefficient\n",
    "2. Spearman's correlation coefficient\n",
    "3. Kendall's Tau\n",
    "4. Euclidean Distance\n",
    "5. Manhattan Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn why sometimes one metric works better than another by looking at a specific situation where one metric provides more information than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Cases For Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will look at the four ideas needed for businesses to implement successful recommendations to drive revenue, which include:\n",
    "1. Relevance\n",
    "2. Novelty\n",
    "3. Serendipity\n",
    "4. Increased Diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this lesson, you will have gained a ton of skills to build upon or to start creating your own recommendations in practice."
