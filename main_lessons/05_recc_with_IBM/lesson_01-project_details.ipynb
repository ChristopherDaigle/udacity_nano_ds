    "# Recommendations with IBM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "For this project you will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles you think they will like. Below you can see an example of what the dashboard could look like displaying articles on the IBM Watson Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src='proj_det_00.png' width=500></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the above dashboard is just showing the newest articles, you could imagine having a recommendation board available here that shows the articles that are most pertinent to a specific user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine which articles to show to each user, you will be performing a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform. You can create your own account to become a part of their community, and get a better understanding of their data by [creating an account on the platform here.](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Tasks\n",
    "Your project will be divided into the following tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before making recommendations of any kind, you will need to explore the data you are working with for the project. Dive in to see what you can find. There are some basic, required questions to be answered about the data you are working with throughout the rest of the notebook. Use this space to explore, before you dive into the details of your recommendation system in the later sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rank Based Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started in building recommendations, you will first find the most popular articles simply based on the most interactions. Since there are no ratings for any of the articles, it is easy to assume the articles with the most interactions are the most popular. These are then the articles we might recommend to new users (or anyone depending on what we know about them).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User-User Based Collaborative Filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build better recommendations for the users of IBM's platform, we could look at users that are similar in terms of the items they have interacted with. These items could then be recommended to the similar users. This would be a step in the right direction towards more personal recommendations for the users. You will implement this next.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Content Based Recommendations (EXTRA - NOT REQUIRED)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the amount of content available for each article, there are a number of different ways in which someone might choose to implement a content based recommendations system. Using your NLP skills, you might come up with some extremely creative ways to develop a content based recommendation system. You are encouraged to complete a content based recommendation system, but not required to do so to complete this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Matrix Factorization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will complete a machine learning approach to building recommendations. Using the user-item interactions, you will build out a matrix decomposition. Using your decomposition, you will get an idea of how well you can predict new articles an individual might interact with (spoiler alert - it isn't great). You will finally discuss which methods you might use moving forward, and how you might test how well your recommendations are working for engaging users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you submit your work, check the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2322/view) to make sure you meet all of the rubric items."

    "|Code is functional and passes all tests.| All the project code is contained in a Jupyter notebook or script. If you use a notebook, it demonstrates successful execution and output of the code. All tests have passing remarks.|\n",
    "|Write code that is well documented and uses functions and classes as necessary.| Code is well documented and uses functions and classes as necessary. All functions include document strings. DRY principles are implemented.|\n",

    "\n",
    "|CRITERIA|MEETS SPECIFICATIONS|\n",
    "|:-|-|\n",
    "|Create ranked based recommendation model.|Tests will ensure that your functions will correctly pull the top articles. The two functions should pull the top ids and the top names.|\n",

    "\n",
    "|CRITERIA|MEETS SPECIFICATIONS|\n",
    "|:-|-|\n",
    "|Create the user item matrix.|Create a matrix with users on the rows and articles on the columns. There should be a 1 if a user-article interacted with one another and a zero otherwise.|\n",
    "|Find similar users needed for user-user collaborative filtering model.|Find similar users needed for user-user collaborative filtering model. Write a function that finds similar users.|\n",
    "|Make recommendations using user-user based collaborative filtering.|Make recommendations using user-user based collaborative filtering. Complete the functions needed to make recommendations for each user.|\n",
    "|Improve recommendations using user-user based collaborative filtering.|Improve your original method of using collaborative filtering to make recommendations by ranking the collaborative filtering results by users who have the most article interactions first and then by articles with the most interactions.|\n",
    "|Provide recommendations for new users.|Provide recommendations for new users, which will not be able to receive recommendations using our user-user based collaborative filtering method.|\n",

    "|Perform SVD on user-item matrix.|Perform SVD on user-item matrix. Provides U, Sigma, and V-transpose matrices, as well as an explanation of why this technique works in this case.|\n",
    "|Perform split of training and testing datasets.|Split the user-item matrix into training and testing segments. Identify the users in the test set that are also in the training.|\n",
    "|Perform assessment of results.|Perform assessment of the predicted vs. the actual values.|\n",
    "|Results discussion.|Provide a discussion about the results, as well as a method by which you could test how well your recommendation engine is working in practice.|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!\n",
    "* Ways to stand out are to move your notebook into a web application, and blend your code into a class that can be easily used with a web application. You could package your recommendation engine code to be pip installed by others. You could also build out a content based recommendation system using your NLP skills. There are lots of ways to go beyond the rubric for this project!\n",
    "\n",
    "* As other (non-required) work to show off your skills, you can configure your code into a class and deploy your code to a flask app (like in the lessons). Alternatively, you could deploy using Heroku. Again, these steps are not required to complete the project, but can help you push your skills and show off your work to the world."
